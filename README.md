 * ABSTRACT: With the rapid growth of global data, predictive analytics has become ever important.
 * Predictive analytics can help people in many different ways including making better decisions,
 * understanding market trends, and improving productivity. Conventional machine learning techniques
 * used for predictive analytics, such as regression techniques, are typically not sufficient to handle
 * complex data associated with structured knowledge. Deep learning, also called deep structured learning,
 * has received great attentions in recent years for modeling high-level abstractions in data with complex
 * structures. In this thesis, we propose a systematic approach to deriving a layered knowledge structure
 * and designing a structured deep neural network based on it. Neurons in a structured deep neural network
 * are structurally connected, which makes the network time and space efficient, and also requires fewer
 * data points for training. Furthermore, the proposed model can significantly reduce chances of overfitting,
 * which has been one of the most common and difficult to solve problems in machine learning. The structured
 * deep neural network model has been designed to learn from the most recently captured data points; therefore,
 * it allows the model to adapt to the latest market trends. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
 * approach for predictive analytics, we use a case study of predicting house selling prices.
 * A deep neural network has been designed to match with a knowledge structure for house price prediction,
 * with a significantly reduced number of connections comparing to a fully connected neural network.
 * Our experimental results show that a specialized structured deep neural network may outperform conventional
 * multivariate linear regression models, as well as fully connected deep neural networks.
